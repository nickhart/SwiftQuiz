# SwiftQuiz Release Roadmap

## Vision
Transform SwiftQuiz into a comprehensive daily practice tool for Swift developers, featuring intelligent AI feedback, personalized learning paths, and gamification to make learning Swift engaging and effective.

## Current State (Pre-0.1.0)

### ✅ What's Working Well
- Solid SwiftUI + CoreData architecture
- Claude/OpenAI AI integration for answer evaluation
- Basic question types (multiple choice, short answer, freeform)
- Settings system with secure keychain storage
- Daily notification system
- Cross-platform support (iOS/macOS)
- 200 existing questions

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement
- Limited question variety and quality (very terse, repetitive)
- No user preferences for difficulty/categories
- No comprehensive progress tracking
- No daily regimen structure
- Missing achievement/badge system
- No detailed analytics
- Questions are mostly basic types with limited categories
