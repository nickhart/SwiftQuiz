# Phase 3: Advanced Question Generation Strategy

## Overview
Transform SwiftQuiz from basic Q&A to sophisticated, code-driven learning experiences using AI-powered content generation.

## Current Question Quality Analysis

### Problems Identified
- **330 "What is" questions** - extremely repetitive phrasing
- **305 "purpose" mentions** - formulaic structure
- **Limited multiple choice usage** - missing engagement opportunities
- **No code snippets** - purely conceptual vs practical
- **Basic scenarios** - not reflecting real-world Swift development

### Example Current Questions (Poor Quality)
```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of String in Swift?",
  "type": "freeform",
  "answer": null
}
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of Int in Swift?",
  "type": "freeform",
  "answer": null
}
```

## Target Question Archetypes

### 1. Code Debugging Questions
**Format**: Present broken code, ask user to identify/fix the issue
**Difficulty Progression**: Syntax errors → Logic errors → Performance issues

```swift
// Beginner Example
func calculateArea(width: Int, height: Int) -> Int {
    return width + height  // Bug: should be multiplication
}
// Question: "What's wrong with this function?"

// Advanced Example
class DataManager {
    var cache: [String: Any] = [:]

    func fetchData(key: String, completion: @escaping (Any?) -> Void) {
        DispatchQueue.global().async {
            // Simulate network delay
            Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1)
            let data = self.cache[key]  // Bug: accessing cache from background thread
            completion(data)
        }
    }
}
// Question: "What concurrency issue exists in this code?"
```

### 2. Multiple Choice Scenarios
**Format**: Present a programming challenge with 4 realistic options
**Focus**: Best practices, API choice, architectural decisions

```
You need to transform an array of User objects to only include active users,
then extract their email addresses. Which approach is most appropriate?

A) users.filter { $0.isActive }.map { $0.email }
B) users.compactMap { $0.isActive ? $0.email : nil }
C) users.flatMap { $0.isActive ? [$0.email] : [] }
D) users.reduce([]) { $0.isActive ? result + [$0.email] : result }

Answer: A - Clear, readable, and efficient
```

### 3. Code Prediction Questions
**Format**: Show code snippet, ask what it outputs or how it behaves
**Skills**: Understanding of language semantics, memory management, async behavior

```swift
class Counter {
    var value = 0
    lazy var increment: () -> Int = { [weak self] in
        self?.value += 1
        return self?.value ?? 0
    }
}

var counter: Counter? = Counter()
print(counter?.increment())  // What prints?
counter = nil
print(counter?.increment())  // What prints?

A) Optional(1), nil
B) Optional(1), Optional(2)
C) 1, nil
D) 1, 0
```

### 4. API Design Questions
**Format**: Present design challenge, evaluate different Swift API approaches
**Skills**: Protocol design, generics, error handling, naming conventions

```
You're designing an API for network requests. Which design best follows Swift conventions?

A) func request<T>(url: String, completion: (T?, Error?) -> Void)
B) func request<T: Codable>(url: URL) async throws -> T
C) func makeRequest(url: String) -> Result<Data, NetworkError>
D) func performRequest(endpoint: String, callback: @escaping (Data) -> Void)

Answer: B - Uses modern async/await, proper types, follows naming guidelines
```

### 5. Architecture & Patterns Questions
**Format**: Present common iOS scenarios, ask about best architectural approach
**Skills**: MVC vs MVVM, delegation vs closures, memory management

```
You have a table view with custom cells that need to communicate back to the view controller
when a button is tapped. What's the most appropriate pattern?

A) Delegate pattern with weak references
B) Closure-based callbacks stored in the cell
C) NotificationCenter broadcasting
D) Direct reference to view controller

Answer: A - Prevents retain cycles, clear communication contract
```

- Include proper error handling where appropriate
- Follow current Swift conventions (5.10+)
- Avoid deprecated APIs
- Include relevant iOS/Foundation frameworks

Generate a question that tests practical understanding, not just memorization.
```

### Phase 3.3: Content Generation Pipeline (Week 2-3)

#### Automated Question Improvement
**Existing Question Transformation:**
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify all "What is the purpose of X" questions
2. **Contextual Rewriting**: Transform into scenario-based questions
3. **Code Integration**: Add relevant Swift code examples
4. **Multiple Choice Creation**: Generate plausible distractors for suitable questions

**Example Transformation:**
```
// Before
"What is the purpose of optionals in Swift?"

// After
"You're parsing JSON data where some fields might be missing. Your colleague suggests this approach:

let userAge = jsonData["age"] as! Int
let userName = jsonData["name"] as! String

What's the main problem with this code, and how would you improve it?

A) Use optional binding: if let age = jsonData["age"] as? Int
B) Use force unwrapping with nil checks: age != nil ? age as! Int : 0
C) Use implicit unwrapping: var age: Int! = jsonData["age"] as? Int
D) Use string interpolation: "\(jsonData["age"])"

Answer: A - Safe optional handling prevents runtime crashes
```

#### Quality Assurance Framework
**Automated Checks:**
- Swift syntax validation (compile Swift code snippets)
- Difficulty consistency scoring
- Duplicate detection
- Answer key validation

**Human Review Process:**
- Subject matter expert review (iOS developer with 5+ years)
- Beginner testing (actual feedback from junior developers)
- A/B testing in live app

### Phase 3.4: Advanced Content Types (Week 3-4)

#### Interactive Code Challenges
**Progressive Complexity:**
```swift
// Level 1: Fix the Syntax
func greetUser(name String) {  // Missing parameter label
    print("Hello \(name)")
}

// Level 2: Fix the Logic
func fibonacci(n: Int) -> Int {
    if n <= 1 { return n }
    return fibonacci(n: n-1) + fibonacci(n: n-3)  // Wrong: should be n-2
}

// Level 3: Fix the Architecture
class NetworkManager {
    static let shared = NetworkManager()
    var activeRequests: [URLSessionTask] = []

    func performRequest() {
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URL(string: "...")!) { data, response, error in
            // Memory leak: strong reference cycle
            self.activeRequests.removeAll()
        }
        activeRequests.append(task)
        task.resume()
    }
}
```

#### Real-World Scenario Questions
**Framework Integration:**
- SwiftUI state management challenges
- Combine pipeline debugging
- Core Data relationship problems
- UIKit + SwiftUI integration issues

#### Performance & Optimization
**Code Efficiency Questions:**
```swift
// Question: Which implementation is most efficient for large arrays?

// Option A: Traditional loop
func sumPositive(numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
    var sum = 0
    for number in numbers {
        if number > 0 {
            sum += number
        }
    }
    return sum
}

// Option B: Functional approach
func sumPositive(numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
    return numbers.filter { $0 > 0 }.reduce(0, +)
}

// Option C: Single pass
func sumPositive(numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
    return numbers.reduce(0) { $0 + ($1 > 0 ? $1 : 0) }
}

Answer: C - Single iteration, no intermediate array creation
```
